1. Using git branch to see the two branches that are relevant for this exercise named as my_branch and my_branch2

2. Identify the current branch by the one with an asterisk (*) next to it in the output of the git branch command, currently i am on main branch. 

3. Use "$ git branch my_branch" to create a new branch called mybranch.
   
4. Use git branch again to see the new branch created as my_branch and my_branch2
   
5. Use "$ git checkout my_branch" to switch to your new branch.

6. Observe how the output from git status changes when you switch between the master and the new branch that you have created. It will reflect the status of the current branch's working directory.

7. Notice how the workspace changes when you change between the two branches. Files tracked by Git may change to match the state of the current branch.
Ensure you are on your mybranch branch before you continue by using git branch.

8. Create a file called sandhya.txt by using touch command.

9. Add the file to the staging area with "$ git add sandhya.txt".

10. Commit the change with "$ git commit -m "Added sandhya.txt".
    
11. Use git log --oneline --graph to see your branch pointing to the new commit.
    
12.Switch back to the branch called master with using command "$ git checkout main".

13.Use git log --oneline --graph and notice how the commit you made on the mybranch branch is missing on the master branch.

14. Make a new file called Sandhya2.txt using git command as  "$ touch sandhya2.txt"
now use "$ git add sandhya2.txt"
and $ git commit -m "added file2 as sandhya2.txt"

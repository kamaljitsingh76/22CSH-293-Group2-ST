1. First, one person in the group should create a public repository using their GitHub account.![Screenshot 2024-04-12 160916](https://github.com/PRABHA-01/22CSH-293-Group2-ST/assets/148910779/11018af4-aa5e-4c64-994e-022173ac38ad)

2. This same person should then follow the instructions from GitHub to add a remote, and then push their repository. Do not forget the –u flag, as suggested by GitHub!![Screenshot 2024-04-12 160921](https://github.com/PRABHA-01/22CSH-293-Group2-ST/assets/148910779/7b74aeff-91a3-4c3c-b286-44ecdad47727)

3. All of the other members of the group should then be added as collaborators, so they can commit to the repository also.![Screenshot 2024-04-12 160945](https://github.com/PRABHA-01/22CSH-293-Group2-ST/assets/148910779/0b691d4a-3072-4f1b-8e95-966ae45356bf)

4. Next, everyone else in the group should clone the repository from GitHub. Verify that the context of the repository is what is expected..![Screenshot 2024-04-12 160916](https://github.com/PRABHA-01/22CSH-293-Group2-ST/assets/148910779/11018af4-aa5e-4c64-994e-022173ac38ad)

5. One of the group members who just cloned should now make a local commit, then push it. Everyone should verify that when they pull, that commit is added to their local repository (use git log to check for it).![Screenshot 2024-04-12 161454](https://github.com/PRABHA-01/22CSH-293-Group2-ST/assets/148910779/45b38432-1a34-4a1d-8000-a039fae9492b)

6. Look at each other’s git log output. Notice how the SHA-1 is the same for a given commit across every copy of the repository. Why is this important? [Screenshot 2024-04-12 161010](https://github.com/PRABHA-01/22CSH-293-Group2-ST/assets/148910779/e228c5e5-c6e1-4387-8873-4cec2b10862b)  
7. Two members of the group should now make a commit locally, and race to push it. To keep things simple, be sure to edit different files. What happens to the runner-up?![Screenshot 2024-04-12 161019](https://github.com/PRABHA-01/22CSH-293-Group2-ST/assets/148910779/b9587868-d0cf-4556-9c50-89c6b5058a31)  ![Screenshot 2024-04-12 161027](https://github.com/PRABHA-01/22CSH-293-Group2-ST/assets/148910779/9d30511f-256e-42b5-a6fe-da429bc214a3)


8. The runner-up should now pull. As a group, look at the output of the command. Additionally, look at the git log, and notice that there is a merge commit. You may also wish to view the DAG in gitk.  ![Screenshot 2024-04-12 161010](https://github.com/PRABHA-01/22CSH-293-Group2-ST/assets/148910779/62dfe7fc-b076-4d01-9037-52ff1f9652be)

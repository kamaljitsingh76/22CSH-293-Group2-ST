# 22CSH-293-Group2-ST
1. First, one person in the group should create a public repository using their GitHub account.  ![Screenshot 2024-04-12 152436](https://github.com/adarshkrsingh07/22CSH-293-Group2-ST/assets/123314058/9d87c011-c0aa-4363-9d03-12bbd3a9729f)

2. This same person should then follow the instructions from GitHub to add a remote, and then push their repository. Do not forget the –u flag, as suggested by GitHub!![Screenshot 2024-04-12 151621](https://github.com/adarshkrsingh07/22CSH-293-Group2-ST/assets/123314058/217479d1-991a-47b4-9150-3300a52b6a60)

4. Next, everyone else in the group should clone the repository from GitHub. Verify that the context of the repository is what is expected.![Screenshot 2024-04-12 151621](https://github.com/adarshkrsingh07/22CSH-293-Group2-ST/assets/123314058/52b6465f-ed73-450b-88f8-4a423f138e40)

5. One of the group members who just cloned should now make a local commit, then push it. Everyone should verify that when they pull, that commit is added to their local repository (use git log to check for it).![Screenshot 2024-04-12 151635](https://github.com/adarshkrsingh07/22CSH-293-Group2-ST/assets/123314058/3c45a4be-0d19-461e-ba00-aedad075874a)

6. Look at each other’s git log output. Notice how the SHA-1 is the same for a given commit across every copy of the repository. Why is this important?![Screenshot 2024-04-12 151706](https://github.com/adarshkrsingh07/22CSH-293-Group2-ST/assets/123314058/63312e5c-2cd5-46d3-ae7d-30a483079317)

7. Two members of the group should now make a commit locally, and race to push it. To keep things simple, be sure to edit different files.

**What happens to the runner-up?**  ![Screenshot 2024-04-12 151640](https://github.com/adarshkrsingh07/22CSH-293-Group2-ST/assets/123314058/ea027189-bde9-4607-940d-ae4f36b6f92b) 

9. The runner-up should now pull. As a group, look at the output of the command. Additionally, look at the git log, and notice that there is a merge commit. You may also wish to view the DAG in gitk.
